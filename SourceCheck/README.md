### SourceCheck

The first reddit bot I made as a request from r/requestabot.

The bot goes through submissions older than `bot_check_time_in_minutes` in `bot_subreddit` (located in `config.py`) and searches for a comment with (some kind of - never really found out what the subreddit is about) source. If not found, the bot removes the submission.
